# Virtualization and Its Role
 
It allows multiple virtual machines to run on one set of hardware resources through a hypervisor.  
This maximizes the power of cloud computing.
# What Is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is a rapidly growing technology that uses a virtual pool of on-demand shared resources, including compute, database, and network services.  
It's changing the landscape of how many companies operate, offering significant business and technical advantages.
## Cloud Deployment Models
## Public Cloud
The Public Cloud model offers shared infrastructure, accessible over the internet for public usage.  
It's maintained by the Cloud vendor, providing flexibility and scalability.
## Private Cloud
The Private Cloud is privately hosted, managed, and owned by individual companies, offering greater control and security.  
In a private cloud, all resources are isolated and in the control of an organization.  
So, the private cloud is also called the internal or corporate cloud.
## Hybrid Cloud
The Hybrid Cloud model combines both Public and Private Clouds for seasonal burst traffic or disaster recovery.  
It extends the logical internal network of the Private Cloud, offering benefits of both models.
## Cloud concepts
### Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing

### **ON-DEMAND RESOURCING**
Cloud computing offers on-demand resourcing, meaning that resources are immediately available for allocation, eliminating the need to wait for hardware to be ordered, installed, and configured.

### **SCALABILITY**
With cloud computing, you have the ability to rapidly scale your environment's resources both up and down and in and out, depending on your requirements and demands of your application and services.

### **ECONOMY OF SCALE**
Thanks to virtualization technology, cloud computing provides an economy of scale, resulting in exceptionally low resource costs compared to traditional hosting.

### **FLEXIBILITY AND ELASTICITY**
Cloud computing offers huge flexibility and elasticity, allowing you to fully customize your environment using only the resources required.

### **UTILITY-BASED METERING**
Many cloud services operate on a utility-based metering system, meaning you only pay for the resources you use.
## Cloud Service Models

The three main cloud service models: software as a service, platform as a service, and infrastructure as a service.  
Each model offers varying levels of manageability and customization over your solution.

### **SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE**
Software as a service, or SaaS, provides widely distributed and accessed applications like Google's Gmail.  
These applications are fully managed by the provider and accessed over the internet, offering minimal customization from the user's perspective.

### **PLATFORM AS A SERVICE**
Moving up the customization scale, platform as a service, or PaaS, offers a greater level of management and control.  
It provides an application framework on top of the operating system, allowing developers to focus on creating new apps.

### **INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE**
Infrastructure as a service, or IaaS, allows the highest level of customization.  
Users configure their own portion of the cloud, including virtual networks and operating systems, while the underlying host is managed by the vendor.

## How organizations are using cloud computing to their advantage?

### **MIGRATION TO THE CLOUD**
One of the major use cases of cloud computing is migrating production services from on-premise solutions to the cloud.  
With the benefits of scalability and cost-effectiveness in mind, many businesses are choosing to move their existing production services to the public cloud.

### **TRAFFIC BURSTING**
During peak seasons, the public cloud can be used to scale networking resources to manage additional traffic.  
This means you only pay for the extra infrastructure when you need it, making it a cost-effective solution for handling fluctuating traffic.

### **BACKUP AND DISASTER RECOVERY**
The built-in resiliency and durability of public clouds make them a great solution for backup and disaster recovery needs.  
With access to unlimited storage space and cost-effective data management lifecycle policies, cloud computing is becoming a popular choice for enterprises.

### **WEB HOSTING**
Many organizations are opting to host their web services on the cloud due to its ability to load balance across multiple instances and scale up and down quickly based on traffic demands.
